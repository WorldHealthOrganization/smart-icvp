## Business Processes

This page describes the business processes included in the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) for ICVP.

A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

The DAK for ICVP focuses on the following key business processes.
