This page describes the decision support logic included in the WHO
Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) for ICVP.

The decision-support logic component provides the decision logic and algorithms, as well as the scheduling of services, in accordance with WHO guidelines. The decision logic and algorithms in this implementation guide deconstruct the recommendations within the ICVP guidelines and guidance into a machine readable format that clearly labels the inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital
decision-support system.

### Decision Support Logic Overview
The section below provides an overview of the decision-support tables and algorithms for the different business processes in an EIR. The structure of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision Model and Notation (DMNâ„¢), an industry standard for modelling and executing decision logic. These decision-support tables detail the business rules, data inputs and outputs to support EIR business processes.
