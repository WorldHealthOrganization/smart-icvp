Component 3 in the Digital Adaptation Kit (link forthcoming) includes user scenarios, which are narratives that describe how the different personas may interact with each other. The user scenarios are only illustrative and are intended to give an idea of a typical workflow.

**How to interpret user scenarios**

User scenarios can be helpful tools not only to better understand the context in which a digital tool would operate, but also for some insights into what key data elements would need to be recorded and accounted for in the database. Additionally, the context in which the tool would operate, illuminated by the user scenarios, provides insight into some functional and non-functional requirements that the system would also need.

As examples, the scenarios identify: key data elements that need to be recorded and/or calculated; decision-support logic that can be automated in the system; key functional and non-functional requirements that should be included in the system, and adolescent-specific considerations that should be accounted for.

#### ICVP User Scenarios

##### A. Issuing an ICVP
**Key personas:** Individual/Client (Holder), Digital Health Wallet, Certificate Issuance Service

Sarah is planning international travel and needs to obtain a digital International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). She logs into her country's digital health wallet application on her mobile device. Once authenticated, she navigates to the certificate services section and requests the issuance of a digital ICVP card based on her existing immunization records stored in the Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR).
The digital health wallet system displays information about the digitization process and prompts Sarah for her consent to create a digital version of her vaccination records. The system explains how her data will be used and stored. Sarah reviews the information and provides her consent by accepting the terms displayed on screen.
Upon receiving Sarah's consent, the system records this authorization in the consent registry and begins collating her ICVP data from the EIR. The Certificate Issuance Service retrieves her relevant vaccination records, including vaccine type, dates of administration, batch numbers, and administering healthcare facility information.
The system then determines whether to configure the certificate for online or offline verification. For online verification, it generates a Verifiable Health Link (VHL) that points to Sarah's vaccination records stored securely in the national health system. For offline verification, it embeds the complete ICVP payload directly into the certificate. In both cases, the system generates a QR code containing either the VHL or the embedded data, digitally signed by the issuing health authority.
The digital ICVP card is now issued and available in Sarah's digital health wallet. She can view her vaccination details, including the QR code that can be presented for verification at borders or healthcare facilities. The certificate includes her demographic information, vaccination history with all required details for international travel health regulations, the unique certificate identifier, validity period, and the digital signature ensuring authenticity.



##### B. Verifying an ICVP at the Border
**Key personas:** Certificate Holder (traveler), Border Health Official/Verifier, Status Checking Application, National/International Public Health Authority (PHA)

Sarah arrives at the international airport immigration checkpoint for her destination country. As part of the entry requirements, Border Health Officer James requests her proof of vaccination. Sarah opens her digital health wallet on her smartphone and presents her digital ICVP by displaying the QR code on her screen.
Officer James uses the border health authority's status checking application on his tablet device. He initiates the verification process by scanning Sarah's QR code using the tablet's camera. The application first validates that the QR code has the correct format with the HC1 prefix, deserializes the data, and identifies the key ID and issuing authority information embedded within.
The system checks whether the issuing authority is recognized in the trusted network of certificate issuers. Finding that Sarah's certificate was issued by a trusted national health authority, the application fetches the corresponding public key from either the trust network gateway or from its local cache of trusted keys. Using this public key, the system verifies the digital signature on Sarah's certificate to ensure it hasn't been tampered with and was genuinely issued by the claimed authority.
Once the signature is successfully verified, the application determines whether the certificate payload is embedded within the QR code or requires retrieval from the issuing country's Public Health Authority. In Sarah's case, the certificate uses a VHL (online verification approach), so the application sends a secure query to the issuing country's certificate repository to retrieve the full vaccination details.
The National PHA receives the request, identifies Sarah's certificate in the certificate registry, retrieves the complete record from the certificate repository, and returns the vaccination data to the verification application. The system extracts the payload and applies business rules to validate the certificate claim. It checks that Sarah's Yellow Fever vaccination was administered at least 10 days before arrival, that the vaccine hasn't expired, that all required vaccinations for the destination country are present, and that none of the certificates have been revoked.
The verification application displays the result to Officer James. The screen shows a green "Valid" status, confirming that Sarah's certificate is authentic, meets all entry requirements, and has not been revoked or expired. Officer James reviews the displayed information, which includes Sarah's name matching her passport, the vaccination details with dates and vaccine types, and the verification status. Satisfied that everything is in order, he stamps Sarah's passport and allows her to proceed through immigration. The system automatically logs this verification event in the border health surveillance system, recording the date, time, location, certificate ID, and outcome for public health monitoring purposes.
If the status checking application had not been available or experienced technical issues, Officer James would have performed a manual check by visually inspecting Sarah's paper ICVP or the digital certificate display, verifying security features, and checking against published guidelines before making an entry decision.


#### C. Verifying an ICVP for Continuity of Care
**Key personas:** Certificate Holder (patient), Healthcare Provider (Dr. Patel), Status Checking Application, National/International Public Health Authority (PHA)

Two months after returning from her international trip, Sarah develops a fever and visits her local health clinic for medical attention. During the initial consultation, Dr. Patel, the attending physician, asks about Sarah's recent travel history as part of the clinical assessment. Sarah mentions she recently traveled to a Yellow Fever endemic region in West Africa.
Recognizing the relevance to Sarah's current symptoms, Dr. Patel requests to review Sarah's vaccination records. Sarah retrieves her digital health wallet on her phone and displays her digital ICVP. Dr. Patel asks for permission to verify the certificate details for clinical purposes, and Sarah consents by showing the QR code.
Dr. Patel uses the clinic's health information system, which has an integrated ICVP verification module. She scans Sarah's QR code using the system's scanner. The application follows the same verification process used at borders: it validates the QR code format, deserializes the data, identifies the issuing authority, and checks that the authority is recognized in the trusted network. The system retrieves the public key and verifies the digital signature to confirm the certificate's authenticity.
Since the clinic system is configured for online verification and has connectivity to international health networks, it queries the issuing country's Public Health Authority. The PHA identifies Sarah's certificate in their registry, retrieves the complete vaccination record from their repository, and returns the authenticated data. The verification application validates that the certificate hasn't been revoked, checks the vaccination dates and types, and displays the result to Dr. Patel.
The screen shows a "Valid" status with comprehensive vaccination details. Dr. Patel reviews the information displayed: Sarah received her Yellow Fever vaccination 45 days ago, which rules out Yellow Fever as a cause of her current symptoms (the incubation period has passed and she is protected). The record also shows the vaccine product name, manufacturer, batch number (important for tracking any potential adverse events), the administering facility, and confirmation that no adverse reactions were documented at the time of vaccination.
With Sarah's consent, Dr. Patel uses the system's import function to add the verified ICVP data to Sarah's local electronic health record. This integration ensures Sarah's vaccination history is now part of her permanent medical record at the clinic. The system automatically identifies any gaps in Sarah's routine immunizations by comparing the imported data against national immunization schedules, and flags that Sarah is due for a tetanus booster.
Based on the verified vaccination information and clinical assessment, Dr. Patel rules out vaccine-preventable diseases related to travel. She proceeds with alternative diagnostic workup for Sarah's fever. Before Sarah leaves, Dr. Patel counsels her on maintaining her digital ICVP for future travel, schedules the recommended tetanus booster, discusses other vaccinations she might need based on her travel patterns, and advises her to report any delayed adverse events from previous vaccinations.
If the status checking application had been unavailable or if Sarah couldn't produce her digital ICVP, Dr. Patel would have performed a manual assessment. She would ask detailed questions about Sarah's vaccination history, search for any records in connected health information systems, and make clinical decisions based on the available information while being more conservative in ruling out vaccine-preventable diseases.
